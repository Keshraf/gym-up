## â˜€ Inspiration
Saw the existing Solutions but found that they were slowly turning obsolete due to no innovation in the area of User Experience. Gyms near my home use documents and excel to store their member information. These small local gyms don't have the budget to create their own application and software, so they lose their clients to huge gym chains. Hence, this will allow them to compete in this tough market.

## âœ¨ What it does
It aggregates data from various sources throughout the website and presents it in an analytical way to the owner of the gym. This allows them to keep track of various things like finance, users, classes and trainers. This application has three parts: 
- Admin: To access and work with different data obtained from their members
- Trainers: Get to set exercises for their members 
- Members: They can book classes, see their workout plan and set goals.

The Web application has the admin panel. The Trainer and Member will be integrated later. You can check those panels out in the Figma file.

## ðŸ›  How we built it
- Tailwind
- Next
- Coil
- Twilio

## ðŸš§ Challenges we ran into
- At the last moment there was a problem with the Database so I had to shift all the data, making my work on realtime data updates redundant ðŸ˜¢. After integrating Recharts throughout the entire application, while deploying the application, Vercel tells me that it is causing error, so had to scrap that.

## ðŸ’ª Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Pulled off an all-nighter to finish this project solo
- Still continued even after facing so many problems
- Not to brag but Loved the design

## ðŸ¤“ What we learned
- Learned NextJs to build a full-stack application using a single framework
- Learned Twilio (Great product ðŸ¥‚)
- A lot about gyms

## ðŸ¤” What's next for Gym Up
- Making the Trainer and User Interface
- Adding Biometric Functionality and several other features as ideas come along

Hope you liked it! ðŸ™Œ
